# My-Recipes-Android-App
A feature-rich Android recipe app for foodies, chefs and cooking experts. This food recipe app makes it easier than ever to create and manage your own recipes with the powerful, easy-to-use admin page.

The application is created in Android Studio and using the Firebase. It lets you create your own recipe with private features, like adding a link or a recipe you like, updating a recipe when you want to put your own twist on it, and also deleting a recipe if you don't like it anymore. This experience is private to you by providing an account where you can create it for the first time through the registration page. Then you can access it at any time through the login page and of course you can log out if you want to keep your magic recipes for yourself.
